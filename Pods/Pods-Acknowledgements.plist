\f0\b\fs24 \cf2 Matt Legend Gemmell / Instinctive Code Source Code License\

\b0\fs22 Last updated: 9th May 2010
\fs24 \
\
\
Thanks for downloading some of our source code!\
\
This is the license agreement for the source code which this document accompanies (don\'92t worry: you\'92re allowed to use it in your own products, commercial or otherwise).\
\
The full license text is further down this page, and you should only use the source code if you agree to the terms in that text. For convenience, though, we\'92ve put together a human-readable 
\b non-authoritative
\b0  interpretation of the license which will hopefully answer any questions you have.\
\
\

\b \cf3 Green
\b0 \cf2  text shows 
\b \cf3 what you can do with the code
\b0 \cf2 .\

\b \cf4 Red
\b0 \cf2  text means 
\b \cf4 restrictions you must abide by
\b0 \cf2 .\
\
Basically, the license says that:\
\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\ql\qnatural
\ls1\ilvl0\cf2 {\listtext	1.	}You can 
\b \cf3 use the code in your own products, including commercial and/or closed-source products
\b0 \cf2 .\
{\listtext	2.	}You can 
\b \cf3 modify the code
\b0 \cf0  as you wish\cf2 , and 
\b \cf3 use the modified code in your products
\b0 \cf2 .\
{\listtext	3.	}You can 
\b \cf3 redistribute the original, unmodified code
\b0 \cf2 , but you 
\b \cf4 have to include the full license text below
\b0 \cf2 .\
{\listtext	4.	}You can 
\b \cf3 redistribute the modified code
\b0 \cf2  as you wish (
\b \cf4 without the full license text below
\b0 \cf2 ).\
{\listtext	5.	}In all cases, you 
\b \cf4 must include a credit mentioning Matt Legend Gemmell
\b0 \cf2  as the original author of the source.\
{\listtext	6.	}Matt Legend Gemmell is \cf0 not liable for anything you do with the code\cf2 , no matter what. So be sensible.\
{\listtext	7.	}You 
\b \cf4 can\'92t use the name Matt Legend Gemmell, the name Instinctive Code, the Instinctive Code logo or any other related marks to promote your products
\b0 \cf2  based on the code.\
{\listtext	8.	}If you agree to all of that, go ahead and use the source. Otherwise, don\'92t!\

\
Suggested Attribution Format\

\b0 \
The license requires that you give credit to Matt Legend Gemmell, as the original author of any of our source that you use. The placement and format of the credit is up to you, but we prefer the credit to be in the software\'92s \'93About\'94 window. Alternatively, you could put the credit in a list of acknowledgements within the software, in the software\'92s documentation, or on the web page for the software. The suggested format for the attribution is:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural

\b \cf0 	Includes &lt;Name of Code&gt; code by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mattgemmell.com/"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 Matt Legend Gemmell}}\cf6 .
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 \
where &lt;Name of Code&gt; would be replaced by the name of the specific source-code package you made use of. Where possible, please link the text \'93Matt Legend Gemmell\'94 to the following URL, or include the URL as plain text: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mattgemmell.com/"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 http://mattgemmell.com/}}\
\
\

\b Full Source Code License Text\
